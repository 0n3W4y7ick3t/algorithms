my [neovim config](https://github.com/0n3W4y7ick3t/rice/tree/main/.config/nvim) \
 \
Two scripts that compile and run single source file: \
[compiler](https://github.com/0n3W4y7ick3t/rice/blob/main/.scripts/nvim-compiler) and [compiler-red](https://github.com/0n3W4y7ick3t/rice/blob/main/.scripts/nvim-compiler-red), mapped to `<Leader>rc` and `<Leader>rr` in neovim config. \
The later automaticly reads "inp" to stdin, make it handy to test against test cases.

@result: \
AC = Accepted Code \
WA = Wrong Answer \
TLE = Time Limit Exceeded \
MLE = Memory Limit Exceeded \
RTE = Runtime Error

use rg XX to grep for a revisit
