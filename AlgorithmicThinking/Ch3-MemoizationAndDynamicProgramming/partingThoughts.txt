key to solving dynamic programming problems:
find the optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, find how they are related to each other.
the mathematical induction is the natural prove of the correctness of these algorithms, dp, memo, recursion, all the same.


"Many algorithm textbooks delve deeper into the theory and application of memoization and dynamic programming. My favorite treatment is *Algorithm Design* by Jon Kleinberg and Ã‰va Tardos (2006). "
take a look at this book when having time.
